    <p class="col-md-8 padding sub-title product-sans">I'm a UX Designer based out of Jacksonville, Florida. I do visual design, research, and am currently working through interaction design. I can generate markup and styling for pages, and am open to learning new frameworks in the web dev space. Research and data are at the core of the work I do professionally. Curiosity and passion are at the the core of the work I do personally.</p>

    <h1 class="padding col-md-10 large-title product-sans-bold">3-Hour Designs</h1>
    <p class="padding sub-title product-sans">To keep the hunger alive I like to work on what I call 3-Hour Designs. Give or take 1 hour on either side, I design something I'm interested in as rapidly as possible. No research, no paper or pen, just me and the tool I choose to use. Check them out by clicking below!</p>

    <p class="padding sub-title-black product-sans">Because of the company that I currently work for, there are a ton of regulations (big banks, woohoo!). One of these regulations is not sharing work on public domains like this site. I'm more than happy to share some of what I've created professionally if you email me below. There are still some designs that are strictly confidential, and in those circumstances I'd be more than happy to discuss them.  </p>

    <h1 class="padding col-md-10 large-title product-sans-bold">Personal Work</h1>
    <p class="padding sub-title product-sans">I try and find developers, designers, and like-minded people to work on projects outside of work. Rather than just designing, I want to work on a team to ultimately deploy an application or website. This gives me the opportunity to work with the latest toolsets and methodologies. Check out some of the projects I'm currently working on or have worked on in the past!</p>
